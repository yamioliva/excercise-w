MÃ³dule REST:

1. Clone or download

2. npm install

3. node app

These routes will work after the app running:

localhost:3000/api/compareWithMadrid/London

localhost:3000/api/compareTwoCities/London/Mexico

The documentation that I have consulted about the API, you can find it here: www.openweathermap.org/current
